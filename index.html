        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychology MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Stephanie Aquino is currently a first-year undergrad student at the University of California Riverside. She is majoring in Psychology and hopes to someday work with children by running a daycare. Aside from Psychology, Stephanie has an interest in education and will be double-majoring in Education. Stephanie is a first-generation student, this means that she is the first in her family that have graduated high school and is now pursuing a college education. She was born and raised in South Central Los Angeles. She hopes to inspire her younger siblings to also attend a four-year university, and to make her family proud. In high school, Stephanie immersed herself in leadership positions. She was the leader of big events such as Heal the Bay, Spirit Week committee, March Madness, and Blood Drives. Stephanieâ€™s interest in Psychology began in her senior year of high school. Her AP Psychology teacher taught psychology in a manner that was intriguing, she wanted to understand why humans act the way they do. Stephanie has always been considered a children-person when kids are not able to put in words what is concerning them she has a way in figuring it out. Stephanieâ€™s main focus in her college education is to make a career by doing the things she is passionate about. Her two goals are to help children in inner-city neighborhoods and opening an after school center where children are able to attend if they do not have a place to go when school ends.<br><br>

        Stephanie is an avid fan of horror films, food, and fashion. Her bizarre interest in anything horror derived from listening to scary folk tales in Mexico. In Mexico, her family lives in a ranch that is surrounded by valleys and fields of corn. It is a perfect setup for a good scary story, and she can casually watch a horror film by herself. Stephanieâ€™s parents have a business selling tacos which is where her love for food accumulated. Since then she has expanded her palette by trying out different cuisines and is always able to try new foods with friends. Fashion has always been a passion for Stephanie and her main inspirations are Zoe Kravitz, Naomi Campbell, and Mary Quant. Her style ranges from vintage pieces, to early 90s, and Y2K early 2000â€™s. Majority of the clothes that Stephanie purchases are from thrift-stores, vintage shops, and Depop(an online thrift-store). She believes that the best items one can buy have is second-hand. It is sustainable and is not fast-fashion which causes damage to the environment.<br><br>

        Stephanie has experience working well with others. She listens to the ideas of others, delegates fairly, and is always up for a challenge. Her employers will say that Stephanie is quick on her feet, thinks about future plans, and does things diligently. Her colleagues will say that Stephanie is selfless, accountable, and fair. Stephanie understands the meaning of hard work and believes that you earn good things by being true to yourself and your work. She will be excellent for any position offered to her.
